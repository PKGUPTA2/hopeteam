                <p><strong>Patients have a voice.</strong>&nbsp;Gateway engages patient representatives of every level of the organization, up to and including our <a href="https://www.gatewaycr.org/about-gateway/board-of-directors/" target="_top" title="Board of Directors">Board of Directors</a>. Patient voice helps develop Gateway investment priorities, and as part of Gateway grant agreements, investigators are asked to reach this same high standard of engagement with patients.<br><br><strong>Cancer patients feel better and live longer.</strong>&nbsp;Gateway's quality of life and burden of treatment focus sets it apart from other cancer research organizations...<em>&nbsp;our goal is to heal the patient even as we conquer the disease</em>. For individual patients, as well as the future of cancer treatment, clinical trials represent the best probability of ending cancer without reducing quality of life to an unacceptable degree. <br><br><strong>Gateway invests in breakthrough research that is both targeted and precise</strong>. Most cancer drugs do not receive a positive response from the majority of patients due to unique genetics and differences among individuals. With the level of genetic and cell protein data now available, Gateway invests in therapies targeted to the specific biology, characteristics and environment of each patient.&nbsp; <br><br><strong>99 cents of every dollar</strong><strong>&nbsp;Gateway receives goes directly to fund Phase I and Phase II clinical trials</strong>. The research Gateway funds cannot be overstated<em>. Phase I and Phase II clinical trials are underfunded, yet have the greatest patient impact in conquering cancer. </em>Thanks to generous underwriting, 99 cents of every dollar received funds cancer clinical trials. Gateway believes that if you donate to cancer research, your donation should go to cancer research.<br><br><strong><img style="width: 97px; height: 71px;max-width:100%;height:auto;" src="img/guidestar2.png?width=97&amp;height=71" alt="GuideStar Gold" align="right" data-id="7688">By demonstrating a commitment to transparency, Gateway has achieved Gold Participant status on Guidestar</strong> – a 501(c)(3) charity that collects, organizes, and presents publicly available information on nonprofit organizations.<br><br></p>
